The project aims to manufacture an assistive walking device that reduces the number of accidents elders face by integrating modern sensing and processing technologies. 

## Background
Cognitive and sensory abilities tend to deteriorate as one ages. According to WHO, adults older than 65
years suffer the greatest number of fatal falls. Factors like environmental hazards, awareness, and assistive device
disregard are all related and can be minimized with smart solutions. Normal wooden canes are cool, but their only function is to reduce the weight on the person's legs. My idea is to have a cane that does all the factors above at the same time. The cane is projected to detect obtacles and reduce the rate of injury.
